- **Skill Radar & Tracking**: Visual tracking of user progress through Recharts radar charts.
- **Resource Library**: Curated recommendations for books and TED talks tailored to specific interpersonal skills.
- **Progressive Web App**: Installable locally with a custom minimalistic brain logo and dark-styled bottom navigation.

## 🏗️ Architecture

MindGrow is a single-page React application scaffolded with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React 18
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS with custom inline React styles and the 'Inter' web font.
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts (for the Skill Radar displaying profile stats).
- **AI Integration**: Direct integration with Anthropic's Claude API to provide context-aware feedback for interpersonal exercises.
- **State Management**: React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) and `localStorage` to persist the onboarding state.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy
The UI relies heavily on a clean, modern aesthetic utilizing glassmorphism-inspired transparency, warm dynamic colors assigned to individual skills, scalable vector graphics (SVG) for the primary brain icon, and responsive layouts capable of running seamlessly on both mobile devices and desktops.
